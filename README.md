I am currently working on collecting my previous works to put in a portfolio, and working on personal projects to build my skills further. Most of the files currently available are completed school projects and assessments.

Most recently, I worked on a team of 6 people to repair bugs on Indio Network's new school management website, https://eagleeyeprogram.com/MainPanel, as part of my Capstone project to finish my diploma. I recieved a final mark of 95% on my Capstone project, thanks to my wonderful team, program chair, Steve Chattergoon, and client, Bryan Richardson.

In the meantime, take a look at my more recent course project from NAIT.
