That is until we find out his real name is Joey Cusack and he's been in hiding for twenty some-odd years.What exactly did he do for his brother Richie in Philly, why did he try to rip Carl's eye out with a barbed knife, and why is he so good at killing people? Obviously he was in the mob, was extremely violent, and had quite a past to hide from.",
