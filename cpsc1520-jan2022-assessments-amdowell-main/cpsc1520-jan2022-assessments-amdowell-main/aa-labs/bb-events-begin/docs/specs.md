# Lab 2 - Working with Events [8%]

You have been supplied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for this assessment. This assessment tests your ability to:

- Create JavaScript event listeners and event handler functions.

## Instructions

> All of your work is to be done in the **`main.js`** file. Do **NOT** modify any other file.

Notice in the HTML file there is a `p.feature.title` element with no content; this is by design. Your task is to add the following event listeners to respond to mouse events for the image.

1. Add an event listener for the `mouseover` event of the `img.feature` element when it is visible on the page. The function that handles the event must set the `innerHTML` of the `p.feature.title` element to the value of the `alt` attribute of the `img.feature` event target. This attribute is set in the code given, when the image is made visible.
1. Add an event listener that will reset the `innerHTML` of the `p.feature.title` element to an empty string when the mouse is moved away from the `img.feature` element. (You will have to research the name of the proper event when the mouse is moved away.)
