# Lab 1 - DOM Access & Functions [8%]

You have been supplied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for this assessment. This assessment tests your ability to:

- Create a simple JavaScript function
- Use a function provided

----

## Instructions

In the JavaScript file, create a function named `italics` that accepts a single parameter value and returns that value enclosed within the italics `<i></i>` tag. Ensure that the function cannot be modified in the browser.

----

## Testing

You can test the behaviour of your function in the browser's console window. The `updateInnerHTML` function is provided to aid you in testing your function. Use it along with your `italics` function to change the `'span.note'` element's `innerHTML` to have its current value wrapped with the `<i>` tags. The HTML for that element should then look as follows:

```html
<span class="note"><i>Note:</i></span>
```
