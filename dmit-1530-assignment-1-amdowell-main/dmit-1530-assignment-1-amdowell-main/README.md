# DMIT 1530: Assignment 01

**Weight**: 15% of your final mark

The due date for this assignment is available on your GitHub Classroom assignment, as well as on Moodle. 

For this assignment, you will build a **three page** website with a **responsive layout**.

The following instructions will help you work through the image preparation, HTML, and CSS required to create this website.

## Image Preparation

Although you've been given a number of image files to work with, they are not web-ready. Before you can use them in your website, you must prepare them by:

1. converting them to a newer image format, such as .webp;

2. ensuring that no image exceeds 250 kilobytes in size; and

3. creating a small, medium, and large version of each background image for each of your three layouts. 

In order to do this, you can use an application such as Adobe Photoshop CC or Squoosh[https://squoosh.app/].

>> **Note**: You do not need to create three versions of *every* image on your page, only your background images.

## HTML

Before adding any styles, you must mark-up all of your content. Begin by filling in the meta information in the &lt;head&gt; of each HTML document; remember to give a unique &lt;title&gt; and description for each page. Then, start building your &lt;body&gt; by pasting all of the content from the **website-content markdown file** into your HTML files, semantically marking them up, and adding appropriate sectioning elements.


### Navigation & Footer

The top-level navigation, main menu, and footer will be identical on every page of your website. A third menu can be found exlusively on the index page. 

Once you've written the code for your top-level navigation, main menu, and footer, copy and paste it into all three of your pages.


#### Functionality

The top-level navigation, index page navigation, and footer will not function. Instead of linking to external website or other pages within your framework folder, use a moot or placeholder link.

```HTML
<!-- moot or placeholder value -->
<a href="#"> ... </a>
```

However, the main menu must link to the following pages within your framework folder:

1. index
2. your home
3. community

The main menu should function from any page within the website.

Finally, make sure that the XYZ Power heading links back to the index page.

### index

The main area of your index page will have two containers. They will switch from a single column layout in the smallest view to a two-column layout in your first media query. 

Both of these containers will have a faux button (i.e. an anchor element styled to look like a button) with a hover state. They will not link to anywhere, but have a placeholder href value.

---

### Validation

Your HTML must **validate without any errors**; however, a warning that your website uses filler text rather than English is acceptable.

---

## CSS

Working within a single stylesheet, ``styles.css``, you will utilise flexbox and flexbox properties to create unique layouts for each of your pages. 

### Colour Palette

The following colours are used throughout the website:

1. dark blue:   #084272;
2. light blue:  #E5F5FA;
3. medium blue: #005FAA;
4. light grey:  #F5F5F5;
5. green:       #6ba23f;

For the semi-transparent box near the bottom on the community page, try using the following value:

```CSS

	rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85);

```


### Universal & Typographic Styles

Every typographic element on the webpages uses:

```CSS
{
	font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;
}
```

#### Headings

The following values are provided to you in pixels; however, you must use relative units (ex. em, rem) in order to receive a mark.

* h1: 36px

* h2: 30px

* h3: 34px

* p: 18px


### Navigation & Footer

#### Hover States

Each level of navigation or menu will have a different hover state. Refer to the provided screenshots in Moodle in order to see an example. 


##### Top-Level Navigation

The background colour of each anchor tag turns green. 

> **Hint**: You may need to make the anchor tag take up 100% of the height and width of its parent container in order to do this successfully.


##### Main Menu

The text colour turns green and an underline is added.


##### index Navigation

The background colour of the faux-button turns medium blue; the font colour turns white.

The faux-buttons turn light blue with medium blue text and a dark blue border.


##### Your Home & Community Navigation

The background-colour for all of the labels  underneath the six images in the upper area of the page will switch from dark blue to medium blue.

The links underneath the lorem ipsum filler text will switch to green.


##### Footer Navigation

The font colour turns green.

### Media Queries

As you work through the media queries for each page, be mindful of the specificity and scope of your selectors.

You should have a minimum of two media queries, for a total of three 'views' or layouts. You will *need to choose* which breakpoints (i.e. which minimum widths) achieve the look, feel, and functionality of the website in your provided screenshots. 

When defining padding and margins, do not fixate on a pixel-perfect measurement. Instead, focus on making sure that the layout is fluid and looks good at any viewport width. Do this by utilising relative units and flexbox properties such as ``justify-content`` and ``align-items``.


#### A Note on Your Fixed-Width Layouts

At your largest breakpoint or view, your layout should switch to a fixed-width centred layout.

Even when you switch to a fixed-width layout, your background colours and background images should span the entire width of the viewport. 


#### A Hint About Differentiating Page Layouts

If you find that you are having difficulty differentiating between each page with a single stylesheet, try adding a unique class to a high-level element and using this class in your selector statements.
